<h1>Dogs for Sale</h1>

<p>Welcome to the dog shop. Here is where I sell dogs.</p>

	<div id="description"><p>This is a Golden Retriever</p></div>
</div>
		<div id="info">
			<div id="health">
				<p id="content">Goldens are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health conditions including elbow and hip dysplasia; eye conditions such as juvenile cataracts, pigmentary uveitis, and progressive retinal atrophy; and certain heart diseases, including subvalvular aortic stenosis. The Golden's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="grooming">
				<p id="content">Goldens heavily shed their thick, water-repellant double coat once or twice a year, and they also shed more moderately on a continuous basis. Most of the time, a good brushing-out with a slicker brush once or twice a week will remove much of the dead hair before it has a chance to fall onto the furniture. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="exercise">
				<p id="content">Like most Sporting breeds, Goldens need plenty of daily exercise. A Golden who doesn't get enough exercise is likely to engage in undesirable behavior. Goldens make great companions on long runs and bike rides, although consultation with a vet is recommended before starting strenuous or high-impact activities that might cause stress to the dog's bones and joints.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="training">
				<p id="content">As with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of seven weeks and four months will help the Golden develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="nutrition">
				<p id="content">A high-quality dog food appropriate for the dog's age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the breed needs.</p>

	<div id="description"><p>This is a Beagle</p></div>
</div>
		<div id="info2">
			<div id="health">
				<p id="content">Responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health conditions such as hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, luxating patella (a dislocated kneecap), and eye disorders.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="grooming">
				<p id="content">The Beagle has a smooth, dense double coat that gets heavier in the winter, so spring is shedding season. Beagles also shed moderately year-round. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, a rubber grooming mitt or tool, or a hound glove will remove the loose hair, and promotes new hair growth as well. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="exercise">
				<p id="content">Beagles are active, energetic dogs who need at least an hour of exercise every day. This doesn't mean just letting them out in the backyard. Beagles were bred to work in packs and are happiest when they have company.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="training">
				<p id="content">As with all dogs, early socialization and puppy training classes are a must. Treats are a huge aid in training. Beagles do not respond well to harsh techniques, but patience, positive reinforcement and even a little creativity will win out in the end.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="nutrition">
				<p id="content">The Beagle should do well on a high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your veterinarian's supervision and approval.</p>

	<div id="description"><p>This is a German Shepard</p></div>
</div>
		<div id="info3">
			<div id="health">
				<p id="content">German Shepherd Dogs can experience bloat, a sudden and life-threatening swelling of the abdomen, and owners should educate themselves about its symptoms and what to do should bloat occur.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="grooming">
				<p id="content">The German Shepherd Dog has a medium-length, double coat consisting of a dense, harsh, and close-lying outer coat with a softer undercoat. The breed is easy to maintain, usually requiring just a quick brushing every few days or so to help remove loose hairs, but they do shed more profusely once or twice a year. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="exercise">
				<p id="content">As a very active and athletic breed, the German Shepherd requires lots of exercise for his physical and mental well-being. With a puppy, you can start with short daily walks, as well as play sessions in a safely fenced area.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="training">
				<p id="content">The German Shepherd is a highly intelligent companion and an extraordinary worker. Consistency and positive, reward-based training will yield excellent results. </p>
			</div>
			<div id="nutrition">
				<p id="content">A high-quality dog food appropriate for the dog's age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the breed needs. Table scraps can cause digestive upset, so only give them sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with high fat content.</p>
